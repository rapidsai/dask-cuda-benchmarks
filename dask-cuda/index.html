    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Some
      simple <a href="https://github.com/rapidsai/dask-cuda/">dask-cuda</a>
      benchmarks, measuring throughput over time
    </p>
    <h2>Multi-node experiments</h2>
    <p>
      These are run on Draco,
      see <a href="https://github.com/wence-/dask-cuda-benchmarks/">the
        run scripts</a>.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="multi-node-merge.html">Merge throughput</a></h3>
    <p>
      This measures achieved throughput / GPU in a multi-node weak scaling
      experiment. Each worker has 40M rows, and the total processed
      data is <code>ngpu * nrow * 2 * 8 * 2</code> bytes
    </p>
    <h3><a href="multi-node-transpose.html">Transpose sum</a></h3>
    <p>
      This measures achieved throughput / GPU in a multi-node strong scaling
      experiment. The benchmark transposes a distributed 2D array
      (of size 50000 x 50000), adds it to itself (pointwise parallel),
      before summing up all entries. The total processed data
      is <code>nrow * ncol * 8</code> bytes.
    </p>
    <h2>Single-node experiments</h2>
    <p>
      These are run as part of the
      UCX-Py <a href="https://github.com/pentschev/ucx-py-ci">nightlies</a>,
      which also contains historical performance for point-to-point
      message passing.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="single-node-merge.html">Merge throughput</a></h3>
    <p>
      This measures achieved throughput / GPU in a single-node
      experiment. Each worker has 100M rows, and the total processed
      data is <code>ngpu * nrow * 2 * 8 * 2</code> bytes
    </p>
    <h3><a href="single-node-transpose.html">Transpose sum</a></h3>
    <p>
      This measures achieved throughput / GPU in a single-nodes
      experiment. The benchmark transposes a distributed 2D array
      (of size 25000 x 25000), adds it to itself (pointwise parallel),
      before summing up all entries. The total processed data
      is <code>nrow * ncol * 8</code> bytes.
