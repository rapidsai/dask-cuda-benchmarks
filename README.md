# RAPIDS Standard Repo Template

This is repo is the standard RAPIDS repo with the following items to make all RAPIDS repos consistent:

- GitHub File Templates
  - Issue templates
  - PR template
- GitHub Repo Templates
  - Issue/PR labels
  - Project tracking and release board templates
- Files
  - `CHANGELOG.md` skeleton
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` skeleton
  - `LICENSE` file with Apache 2.0 License
  - `README.md` skeleton


## Usage for new RAPIDS repos

1. Clone this repo
2. Find/replace all in the clone of `___PROJECT___` and replace with the name of the new library
3. Inspect files to make sure all replacements work and update text as needed
4. Customize issue/PR templates to fit the repo
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with next release version, see [changelog format](https://docs.rapids.ai/resources/changelog/) for more info
6. Add developer documentation to the end of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` that is project specific and useful for developers contributing to the project
    - The goal here is to keep the `README.md` light, so the development/debugging information should go in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
7. Complete `README.md` with project description, quick start, install, and contribution information
8. Remove everything above the RAPIDS logo below from the `README.md`
9. Check `LICENSE` file is correct
10. Change git origin to point to new repo and push
11. Alert OPS team to copy labels and project boards to new repo

## Usage for existing RAPIDS repos

1. Follow the steps 1-9 above, but add the files to your existing repo and merge
2. Alert OPS team to copy labels and project boards to new repo
